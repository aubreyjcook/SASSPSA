                        <h3>Dehydration</h3>
                        <p>Dehydration is a common condition suffered by people at all times of year, but during hotter months people are more susceptible to this condition. Dehydration occurs if fresh water intake drops below the regular output of the human body. The main cause of Dehydration is not drinking enough or replacing one's drinking fluids with the wrong sort of fluids. Purified water is the best option for most people to drink. Sports drink provide electrolytes that correct chemical imbalances in the body as well as hydration, however, electrolyte depletion is fairly rare since most people's electrolyte needs will be met from the food they eat. Sports drinks also have added sugars, which can provide an energy boost but excess sugar intake can actually contribute to dehydration. Alcoholic drinks in particular are something to avoid, since ethanol (the active subtance in alcohol) must be processed by the body with H2O, and modern purified liqours are made with high quality ethanol in large quantities, this can quickly contribute to dehydration.</p>
                        <p>Dehydration is characterized by general lethargy, weakness of the body, and a degradation of mental functions in the beginning, but as a water deficit in the body continues to increase, dehydration can become a progressively more dangerous condition that will ultimately result in death of the sufferer. Near the end of the progression of dehydration, the sufferer will lose consciousness, and at this point they will require immediate emergency professional medical assistance. The best defense against this condition however is regular fluid intake and keeping ready access to fresh purified water.</p>

                        <h3>Heat Stroke</h3>
                        <p>Heat Stroke is a condition caused by continued exposure to excessive heat levels that the body cannot handle. Heat stroke is an extremely dangerous condition that results in incapacitation, and eventually death. One of the main dangers of heat stroke in the hotter months is that it cannot be prevented simply by hydration, and while the elderly are more susceptible, people of any age can succumb to it. Once heat stroke truly reaches onset, the person suffering will also be unconscious and unable to help themselves. Someone who is reaching the onset of heat stroke will generally be struck by delirium and show signs of decreased mental function, difficulty speaking, and will struggle with simple questions. The best way to prevent heat stroke is to stay out of excessive heat for prolonged periods of time, access to air conditioned areas is particularly beneficial, and while working breaks should be taken regularly to cool down. Someone who is undergoing heat stroke should receive immediate professional medical attention, but in the mean time they should be moved to a cool place in which they can recover, and given regular fluid intake. One option to help someone suffering heat stroke in an emergency is to submerge them in cooled water, but they should never be left unattended in a pool or bath of any kind since the threat of drowning is a potential problem.</p>

                        <h3>Sun Poisoning</h3>
                        <p>Sun Poisoning affects people every year and can be seen as a minor condition in the form of sun burns, but in excess can be characterized by extreme burns on the body and a destruction of the bodies normal processes. Exposure to the sun includes exposure to ionizing rays of radiation, while the body is able to tolerate a certain level of this, excessive exposure is extremely dangerous. During the onset of sun poisoning, a person must be treated by staying out of the sun completely, extreme exposures will require direct professional medical care. The prevention of Sun poisoning requires limited exposure to direct sunlight throughout the day, while in direct sunlight, sunscreen should be used to shield against exposure</p>
